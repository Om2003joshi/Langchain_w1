His mother Saroj Kohli is a homemaker while his father Prem Nath Kohli worked as a criminal lawyer. He has an elder brother Vikas and an elder sister Bhawna. His formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. His early education was at Vishal Bharti Public School. As per his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a 3-year-old. He would pick up a bat and request his father bowl to him. In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created. In May, his father arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma. Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed his ability merited more than gully cricket.\\nKohli was unable to secure a place in the U-14 Delhi team, due to extraneous factors. His father reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would ensure his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the U-15 team.

Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under his belt. So, his selection was considered a \"surprise call-up\". During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series. On August 18, 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara. However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli scored his maiden half century in the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.\\nFollowing the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008. Despite limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the single innings that he participated in, scoring 49 runs. In October 2008, Kohli participated in a four-day tour match against Australia as part of the Indian Board President\\'s XI team. The match featured a formidable Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting prowess by scoring 105 runs in the first innings and an unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings, demonstrating his ability to perform against high-level international competition.\\nIn November 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the squad for the home ODI series against England. However, he was not given an opportunity to play in any of the matches. In December 2008, Kohli was awarded a Grade D contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as part of the annual contract list for the Indian national team which entitled him to receive ₹1.5 million (equivalent to ₹4.2 million or US$49,000 in 2023). Despite being awarded a contract, in January, Kohli was dropped for the five-match ODl series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.\\nIn July–August 2009, Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament, held in Australia. He was selected to open the innings for the Indian Emerging Players team in the tournament, and he went on to have a standout performance. Kohli finished as the tournament\\'s leading run-scorer, with a total of 398 runs from seven matches, at an average of 66.33. He was particularly impressive in the final match, where he scored 104 runs off 102 balls against the South Africa Emerging Players team in Brisbane. His strong performance helped lead his team to a 17-run victory and the tournament title. At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of the Indian national selection committee, expressed his admiration for Kohli\\'s performance during the tournament. Kohli later stated that this tournament was a \"turning point\" in his career.\\nIn August 2009, Kohli returned to the national team after recovering from a minor should')]\n"
