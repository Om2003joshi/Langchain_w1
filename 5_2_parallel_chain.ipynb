    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression problems. The main idea of SVM is to find an optimal decision boundary (hyperplane) that separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM chooses the hyperplane such that the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class is maximized. These nearest data points are called support vectors, and they play a crucial role in defining the position of the hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Margin\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points of both classes. A larger margin leads to better generalization and lower chances of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel Trick\n",
    "\n",
    "When data is not linearly separable, SVM uses the kernel trick to transform data into a higher-dimensional space where separation becomes possible. Common kernels include:\n",

    "Advantages\n",

    "Effective in high-dimensional spaces\n",
